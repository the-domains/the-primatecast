  In this installment of The PrimateCast, we asked students of Kyoto
  University's Primate Research Institute to select their favorite moments from
  the first year and a half plus of the podcast. We then interviewed each
  student, asking them to tell us about their research interests, how they got
  into the field of primate research and why they made their respective podcast
  selections.
